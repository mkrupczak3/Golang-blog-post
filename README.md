# Learning Golang is a decent idea
So, I've been tooling around on some [free](https://github.com/collabnix?tab=repositories) [online](https://github.com/collabnix/gopherlabs) [resources](https://www.slideshare.net/sangambiradar370/welcome-to-gopherlabs-why-go-golang) lately, and...

Even though I _said_ Rust is the [programming language for the next 40 years](https://matthew.krupczak.org/2019/09/27/a-programming-language-for-the-next-40-years-rust/) due to its ability to enable programmers to write fast and safe "go fast" code at a low level, it seems that _human_ society has decieded to build [a bunch of useful things](https://github.com/mkrupczak3/golang_projects_list/blob/master/README.md) in a garbage-collected language simmiliar to [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) from Google called [Go(lang)](https://golang.org/) (those _b&%#@^*$_).


It's interesting how quickly Go has gained popularity, and how pervasive it is amongst the [new stack](https://thenewstack.io/) sort of tools that are starting to take over software and enterprise computing patterns (i.e. Docker, Kubernetes, containers, hip new tech, code that mows your lawn and feeds your cat for you, etc.).

So why is it so popular, even though it's supposedly an [objectively "bad" language](https://web.archive.org/web/20190718142325/https://bluxte.net/musings/2018/04/10/go-good-bad-ugly/)?

My uninformed guess is that it's garbage collected like Java (where you don't have to hand back resources to the machine, you just stop using them and it automatically comes around and "picks up the trash"), so it's open season for anyone who's used to working with higher level languages to get started working with. In addition, I would guess that anyone who's taken intro Computer Science classes (which are often taught in Java) could hop on over and start working with GO.

Also, it seems [Go seems to have some cool features](https://medium.com/@george3d6/the-success-of-go-heralds-that-of-rust-73cb2e4c0500) that make it really useful for networked and multi-threaded (where multiple things are happening at once on one or more CPU cores) code.

You may notice today's blog post is of a different format than usual. That's because I've decided to write it using [markdown](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=markdown+cheat+sheet&t=ffab&ia=answer) on [my Github](https://github.com/mkrupczak3) so that I could write this diatribe, and so that I could include the laundry list of (useful?) [tools that humans have decided to write in Go](https://github.com/mkrupczak3/golang_projects_list) below.

Enjoy!
